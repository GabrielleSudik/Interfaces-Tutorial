public interface Info {

	//interfaces are sort of like classes.
	//you can make methods. BUT...
	
	public void showInfo();
	//interface methods don't have bodies!
	//so how do you use them?
	//tab over to Machine class and look at "implements Info" line
	
	//interfaces can also have constants.
	//and that's it, I think.
